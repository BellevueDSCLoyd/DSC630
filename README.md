# DSC630
This is my final project on SBA Loan Data for DSC 630. It provides for 2 predictive analytics models. One predicts loan repayment with a classification model and the other predicts job creation as a regression model.

A presentation was included with the project as SBA_final.pptx

SBA Loan analysis was performed in R as 630Project.R. 
For convenience this has been converted to html and pdf file format.

The primary model work was performed in Python as FinalProject.ipynb.  

    Model selection for the regression model was performed in Pycaret_Reg.ipynb.
    Model selection for the classification model wasa performed in Pycaret_Cat.ipynb.

    Parameter selection for the regression model was performed in Pycaret_Reg_Tuning.ipynb.
    Parameter selection for the classification model was performed in Pycaret_Cat_Tuning.ipynb.
